# Your code goes here ...
# Add validations to two models to enforce the following business rules:
# Employees must always have a first name present
# Employees must always have a last name present
# Employees have a hourly_rate that is a number (integer) between 40 and 200
# Employees must always have a store that they belong to (can't have an employee that is not assigned a store)
# Stores must always have a name that is a minimum of 3 characters
# Stores have an annual_revenue that is a number (integer) that must be 0 or more
# BONUS: Stores must carry at least one of the men's or women's apparel (hint: use a custom validation method - don't use a Validator class)
# Ask the user for a store name (store it in a variable)
# Attempt to create a store with the inputted name but leave out the other fields (annual_revenue, mens_apparel, and womens_apparel)
# Display the error messages provided back from ActiveRecord to the user (one on each line) after you attempt to save/create the record
